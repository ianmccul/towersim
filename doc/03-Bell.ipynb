    "# Motion of a bell\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we solve the equations of motion for a freely swinging bell, ignoring all other effects such as the clapper, rope, ringer etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A freely swinging bell follows the same motions as a simple pendulum. A simple pendulum is described by the equation of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ddot{\\theta} = - \\frac{g}{l} \\sin \\theta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (around $9.81 ms^{-2}$ at the surface of the Earth), and $l$ is the length of the pendulum. It is a famous result that the motion of the pendulum is independent of its mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the motion of a bell can be described by the same equation, where the 'length' $l$ is replaced by and 'equivalent pendulum length' $l_b$. Normally a pandulum is treated in a simplified fashion, as a point-like mass at the end of a thin rod (which is assumed to have no mass), which makes finding the length $l$ very easy. A bell obviously has a very different mass distribution. The derivation of the equations in the appendix shows that we can obtain the equivalent pendulum length from three quantities, the total mass of the bell $M$, the moment of inertia of the bell about the axis of rotation $I_b$, and the distance from the axis of rotation to the centre of gravity $b$, as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "l_b = \\frac{I_b}{Mb}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, none of these quantities can be determined with any accuracy for a bell -- in principle the approximate mass of the bell is stated by the bell founder, but we need to include also the mass of the headstock and wheel. The moment of interia and the location of the centre of gravity are not easy to determine. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining $l_b$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not difficult to determine the equivalent pendulum length $l_b$ directly, by measuring the oscillation period. If the amplitude of oscillation is small, then we can approximate $\\sin \\theta \\simeq \\theta$, and the equations of motion simplify to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{\\theta} = - \\frac{g}{l_b} \\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which has the solution $\\theta = A \\sin \\omega t$, where $A$ is the amplitude of oscillation (assumed small here), and $\\omega = \\sqrt{g/l_b}$ is the angular frequency. This gives the period:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{l_b}{g}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn't difficult to swing the bell gently when it is in the down position and measure this period, and hence determine $l_b$. However this formula is only correct in the limit of small amplitude. If the bell is swinging more than a few degrees, then this formula gives an incorrect answer. The *exact* period for arbitarily large amplitudes can be obtained by integrating the equation of motion over one period. However this integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, indeed, this equation of motion is essentially the defintion of the elliptic integral of the first kind, typically denoted $K(m)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = 4 \\sqrt{\\frac{l_b}{g}} K(\\sin^2 \\theta_0/2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_0$ is the maximum angle that the bell reaches. The elliptic integral is included in the mathematics libraries of most programming languages, so there isn't really any reason to use anything other than the exact expression. However as long as the amplitude is smaller than around 90 degrees (which it surely is if you are measuring it by swinging a bell by hand), there is a good approximation described by Lima and Arun (arXiv:physics/0510206v3),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "a &=& \\cos \\theta_0/2 \\\\\n",

This is at the 'pendulum distance' on the bell side of the headstock. At this position, it is easy to see that for a freely swinging bell the $x$ acceleration is identically zero. Indeed, the $x$ acceleration here measures exactly the forces acting on the bell. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this position ($r = l_b$, $\\beta = 0$), the $y$ component of the acceleration measures a component due to gravity that is the cosine of the angle, and a component proportional to the square of the velocity of the bell. Thus, if there is also a gyro attached to the bell then the velocity is known and the angle of the bell can be determined quite easily.\n",

    "There is a second 'magic' position for the sensor, which is on the stay side of the bell ($\\beta=180$) and at a distance $r = l_b/2$. In this position, the $y$ force is a constant when the bell is in free motion, because the centrifugal force exactly balances with gravity. The $x$ acceleration is proportional to $-\\sin \\theta$ plus the external forces. With the accelerometer at this position, there is no simple way to determine the angle of the bell and separate out this term from the exernal forces, so even if the sensor could be placed accurately at this position, it doesn't provide so much useful information."
