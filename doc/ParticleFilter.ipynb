    "\n",
    "The problem is, we typically don't know all of the distributions in the above equation.  We do know $g$, since this is the influence of the measurement.  But we generally need to find some approximation for the distribution $q(x_{t+1}|x_t,y_{t+1})$.  A common choice is the so-called bootstrap filter, where we set\n",

    "This procedure avoids having to actually construct the functional form for the distribution $q$, we only need to sample from it.  So in practice, we construct $x_{t+1}$ from $x_t$ by some stochastic process (eg integrating some Langevin equation), and then update the weights based on the measurement $y_{t+1}$.  This works reasonably well, but it isn't very efficient, because when we update the state to find $x_{t+1}$ we don't make any use of the (known) measurement $y_{t+1}$.\n",

    "An alternative, is fully-adapted filtering, where we sample from $q$ itself, and we also need an analyical forms for $f$ and $q$.  How to find these?"
