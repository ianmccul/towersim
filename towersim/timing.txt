When we get a call (go, that's all, bob, splice, etc), we need:

If it is inside the call window then act on it immediately

If we are prior to the call window, then schedule the call for a later row
and allow cancelling up to the start of the call window

If we are later than the call window, then the call should be disabled
until the row has started.


For 'go' and 'stand' we don't need to disable after the call window, it doesn't really
matter if it's a bit late.  (although what happens if we have audible calls off?)
